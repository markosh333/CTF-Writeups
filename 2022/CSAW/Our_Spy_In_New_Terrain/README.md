It is up to you to determine who The Enemy is going to attack next and when they plan to strike! Their newest recruit is on twitter as DarkRoom8109. Good luck. nc misc.chal.csaw.io 5005

### Overview

#### 1. When did the enemy agent join twitter? Please use the format MM/YYYY

Well, this was the easy step. You just had to visit his profile.

#### 2. What is the spy's github username?

After scrolling down to the first tweet we can not find anything related to a GitHub account. So let's try something else.

One possibility is that the enemy deleted some tweet related to his GitHub username. We can use [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) to search for a deleted tweet.

Interesting. Now we can look at the different snapshots to find something. Let's try the most recent snapshot.

Again, after scrolling down we find a suspicious tweet from the enemy.

This confirms our hypothesis.

So let's check another snapshot, randomly I picked the one of August 20.
